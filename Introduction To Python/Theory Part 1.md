## 1.B History of Python
  Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and officially released in 1991. It was inspired by the ABC language and designed to be simple, readable, and powerful. Over the years, Python evolved through major versionsâ€”Python 2.0 in 2000 with garbage collection and list comprehensions, and Python 3.0 in 2008, which introduced modern features but broke backward compatibility. With the end of Python 2 support in 2020, Python 3 has become the standard, continuously improving in performance and usability.

   ## 1.C limination of Python
* Slower Execution: Python is slower than compiled languages like C/C++.

* Not Ideal for Mobile or Frontend: Limited use in mobile apps and browser-based development.

* GIL Restriction: Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits multi-threading in CPU-heavy tasks.

* Higher Memory Usage: Python can consume more memory than low-level languages.

* Runtime Errors: Dynamic typing may lead to unexpected errors during execution.

## 1.D Features of Python
* Easy to Learn and Use â€“ Clean, English-like syntax that enhances readability.

* Interpreted Language â€“ Executes code line-by-line without prior compilation.

* Rich Standard Library â€“ Built-in modules for handling files, math, networking, and more.

* Platform Independent â€“ Write once, run anywhere (Windows, macOS, Linux).

* Open Source with Strong Community Support â€“ Free to use and backed by a global developer community.

## 1.E Scripting Langauge VS Python
Python is commonly used as a scripting language, especially for tasks like automation and quick utilities. However, it goes beyond traditional scriptingâ€”it is a general-purpose programming language capable of building complex software, web applications, data processing systems, and more. While typical scripting languages focus on simple automation, Python supports full-scale application development with extensive libraries and frameworks.

## 1.F Applications  of Python

* Web Development: Build dynamic websites and APIs using frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI.
* Data Science & AI: Used extensively in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
* Automation & Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks, system operations, and workflows using simple scripts and tools.
* Software, Game & App Development: Create desktop applications, games, and mobile apps with tools like Tkinter, Pygame, and Kivy.
* Networking, IoT & Cybersecurity: Used in network automation, IoT projects (e.g., Raspberry Pi), and cybersecurity tasks like penetration testing.

## 1.H  What is Python Used For?
* Web Development â€“ Back-end systems and APIs
* Data Analysis & Visualization â€“ Using Pandas, Matplotlib
* Machine Learning & AI â€“ With libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn
* Automation & Scripting â€“ Automating repetitive tasks
* App & Game Development â€“ Using Kivy, Pygame
* IoT & Embedded Systems â€“ Especially with Raspberry Pi
* Cybersecurity & Networking â€“ For scripting and automation tools
* Scientific & Numeric Computing â€“ With SciPy, NumPy
## 1.I  Flavours of Python
* **CPython** â€“ The default and most widely used implementation, written in C.
* **Jython** â€“ Python implemented in Java, runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* **IronPython** â€“ Python for the .NET framework, written in C#.
* **PyPy** â€“ A fast and optimized version of Python with a built-in Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
* **MicroPython** â€“ A lightweight version of Python designed for microcontrollers and embedded systems.
  
 ## 1.J How Python Works?
 * **Source Code (.py)**: You write Python code in a .py file using readable, high-level syntax.
* **Compilation to Bytecode**: Python automatically compiles the source code into bytecode (a low-level, platform-independent representation). This is typically stored in .pyc files.
* **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**: The PVM reads the bytecode and interprets it line-by-line to execute the program. This is where actual program execution happens.

This entire process is managed internally, making Python development simple and efficient.
Flow:
Python Source Code (.py) â†’ Bytecode (.pyc) â†’ PVM â†’ Execution

## 1.K What is PVM
PVM stands for Python Virtual Machine. It is a key component of the Python runtime environment responsible for executing Python bytecode.
* **Executes Bytecode** â€“ PVM runs the compiled Python bytecode (`.pyc`), not the original `.py` file.
* **Platform Independent** â€“ It interprets bytecode on any operating system, ensuring code portability.
* **Part of Interpreter** â€“ PVM is built into the Python interpreter; it's not a standalone component.
* **Handles Runtime Tasks** â€“ Manages memory allocation, error handling, and execution flow.
* **Core Execution Engine** â€“ PVM is the "engine" that brings your Python code to life.
  
## 1.L What is PIP?
`pip` is the **package manager** for Python. It is used to **install, upgrade, and manage** third-party libraries and dependencies in your Python environment.
### ðŸ”§ Basic Usage:
```bash
pip install package-name
Example: pip install numpy
This command installs the numpy library into your current Python environment.
pip makes it easy to add powerful tools and libraries to your Python projects.
```
## 1.L Compiler vs Interpreter

| **Aspect**           | **Compiler**                                            | **Interpreter**                                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**         | Translates the entire code into machine code at once   | Translates and executes code line by line            |
| **Speed**             | Faster after compilation (optimized machine code)      | Slower due to real-time translation                  |
| **Error Detection**   | Detects all errors after full compilation              | Stops at the first error encountered                 |
| **Output**            | Generates a standalone executable file (e.g., `.exe`)  | Does not produce a separate output file              |
| **Example Languages** | C, C++, Java (with JVM)                                | Python, JavaScript, Ruby                             |

| **Aspect**           | **Compile Time**                                     | **Run Time**                                       |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | The phase when source code is converted to bytecode or machine code | The phase when the compiled code is actually executed |
| **Occurs When**       | Before program execution                            | During program execution                           |
| **Error Detection**   | Syntax and static errors are caught                  | Logical and runtime errors are detected            |
| **Impact**            | Affects whether the program can be run              | Affects how the program behaves during execution   |
| **Examples**          | Missing semicolons, type mismatches                 | Division by zero, file not found, null references  |
